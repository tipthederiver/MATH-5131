The observation of this maximal grazing pressure on large number of crops can be explain in a variety of ways. For example, in denser regions lack of light may impact stem development of plants, robbing the leaves of their protein content and making them less attractive to herbivores. Alternatively, these regions may be under watch by the few predators in the system, or herbivores may have greater difficulty penetrating them. \n",

    "Lets take a minute to discuss what we found in the problem above. For $K<5$ or $K>25$ we can see that all the herbivores will die out. For $K=10$ we see that coexistance occures for any density of herbivores. But for $K = 20$ we see something very intersting: Coexistance only occures for certain starting values of $H$ and $P$, and those starting values depend on herbivore density more than on plant density. In fact, we see that plant density strictly decreases with herbivore density staying relitivly constant until enough plants are eaten, at which point herbivores begin to die off. As more plants grow, both population may stable recover or may not. \n",
