    "When the topic of enzyme kinetics first emerged, almost nothing was known about the physical nature of enzymes and the possible mechanisms of rate enhancement. Let us start with a thought experiment considering the dependence of the rate of a simple chemical reaction as a function of reactant concentration $S$. In this case, the rate of the $S\\longrightarrow P$ reaction can be written as $V = dP/dt = kS$. In other words, the *rate of the reaction is linearly proportional to the concentration of the reactant $S$*. In principle, the rate could be increased to “infinity”—the only limit would be set by the solubility of $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally however this was not the case for two important reasons: First, the initial velocity of product formulation does not scale proportionally to the concentration of substrate. Second there is always a maximum initial velocity, that is the dependence of $dP/dt$ on $S$ is asymptotic as in the images below.\n",

    "The first kinetic model that successfully explained this phenomenon was introduced by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. Their presumption, which nowadays might seem trivial, was revolutionary in their time. They assumed that the enzyme $E$ directly interacts with the substrate $S$ in a stoichiometric manner, the interaction results in a well-defined intermediate complex $ES$, and the interaction leads to thermodynamic equilibrium $dES/dt = 0$. As a tribute to this first successful model, $ES$ has been named the Michaelis complex.\n",

    "Note that there is both a forward and a back reaction between the enzyme $E$, the reactant $S$ and $ES$ but only a forward reaction between the intermediate complex $ES$ and the product $P$. It is usually assume that binding of enzyme and substrate to the $ES$ complex is almost instantiations, and much larger than the breaking of $ES$ complex back into enzyme and substrate or production of product. Mathematically, that means that $a\\gg b\\gg c$.\n",
    "\n",
